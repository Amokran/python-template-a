# python-template-a

A personal and very basic template for most python projects.
Includes a basic structure, a README file, a LICENSE file, and a .gitignore file.
It also includes VERSION, CHANGELOG, and CONTRIBUTING files.
And a requirements.txt file for dependencies.
More than enough to start a basic python project.
If you are looking for a more complete template, check out [another python templates in my GitHub](https://github.com/Amokran?tab=repositories&q=python-template-).
